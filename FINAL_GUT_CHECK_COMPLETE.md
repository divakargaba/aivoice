---

## 🔍 What Was Refined

### 1. Removed Marketing Stats
- ❌ **Before**: "50+ Voices", "10x Faster", "90% Cost savings" (marketing claims)
- ✅ **After**: Removed entirely from landing page
- **Why**: Stats feel like marketing, not professional tool features

### 2. Removed Demo Language
- ❌ **Before**: "See how it works" with Play icon, "View Demo"
- ✅ **After**: Removed secondary CTA, single direct action
- **Why**: "Demo" implies it's not real software

### 3. Simplified Examples Page
- ❌ **Before**: "Sample Fiction Novel", disabled buttons, "Ready to Create Your Own?"
- ✅ **After**: Clean list format, no disabled buttons, "Create your own"
- **Why**: Examples should inform, not sell

### 4. Removed "First" Language
- ❌ **Before**: "Create your first project", "Get your first audiobook created"
- ✅ **After**: "Create a project", "Create project"
- **Why**: "First" implies onboarding, not professional use

### 5. Simplified Empty States
- ❌ **Before**: Heavy cards, multiple CTAs, "Need help?" links
- ✅ **After**: Minimal design, single action, subtle help link
- **Why**: Assume competence, don't over-explain

### 6. Removed "Quick Start" Language
- ❌ **Before**: "Quick Start Guide", "Get your first audiobook created in minutes"
- ✅ **After**: "Workflow", "The process for creating audiobooks"
- **Why**: Professional tools don't need "quick start" sections

### 7. Simplified Settings
- ❌ **Before**: "Coming soon" placeholders
- ✅ **After**: Clean list format, no placeholders
- **Why**: Show what exists, don't promise what doesn't

### 8. Minimal Stats Display
- ❌ **Before**: Card-based stats with icons
- ✅ **After**: Horizontal, minimal stats with icons
- **Why**: Stats are information, not features to highlight
